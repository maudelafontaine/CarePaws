# Pet Finder :dog::cat:

Pet finder is a web application that allows users to find adoptable pets that best matches their needs. From the comfort of their home, they can search available pets from a Montreal organizations and shelters database.

This application was created for Concordia Web Development Bootcamp.

## :thought_balloon: Inspiration

As a pet lover, I want to help animals. I created this application in hope to help pets find a new forever home where they can feel loved an secured. I also wanted to make the search for a new bestfriend more accessible and easy for everyone.

This application was inspired by [PetFinder](https://www.petfinder.com/), an online, searchable database of adoptable pets across the United States, Canada and Mexico.
